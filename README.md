# Play Minesweeper on server through website

In this project I run a Flask server, and when prompted the server will start a Pygame program on the server and feed the Flask server with info, then the Flask server presents the information to the user on a web page.

Python modules used:
 - Flask
 - subprocess
 - pygame
 - random
